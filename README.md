# Arkency.js

Those are small utility functions we're using in a day-to-day manner.

## Usage

All functions inside `lib/` are in the UMD format - you can use them in CommonJS environment by requiring it (`require("arkency-js/lib/Object/remapKeys")`) or you can just include them inside `<script>` tag - then they'll be available in the `window` namespace (`window.remapKeys`).
